## Features

- **Scalable GraphQL server:** The server uses [`graphql-yoga`](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-yoga) which is based on Apollo Server & Express
- **GraphQL database:** Includes GraphQL database binding to [Prisma](https://www.prismagraphql.com) (running on MySQL)
- **Tooling**: Out-of-the-box support for [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground) & [query performance tracing](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-tracing)
- **Extensible**: Simple and flexible [data model](./database/datamodel.graphql) â€“ easy to adjust and extend
- **No configuration overhead**: Preconfigured [`graphql-config`](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-config) setup
